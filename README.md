### Data Models

- <b> Game Model</b>

```json
{
  "game": {
    "player": "String (required)",
    "score": "Number (default: 0.0)",
    "accurate": "Number (default: 0)",
    "questionsId": "Array of ObjectId (ref: 'Question')",
    "category": "String (required)",
    "isGameSaved": "Boolean (default: false)",
    "createdAt": "Date (default: Current timestamp)",
    "expireAt": "Date (default: Current timestamp)"
  }
}
```
**Note:** This project utilizes a <b>[TTL (Time-to-Live) index](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/core/index-ttl/)</b> to <b>automatically delete unsaved games</b> after `300 seconds`. The index is based on the `expireAt` field and is configured to delete games where `isGameSaved` is false. This ensures efficient cleanup of temporary data.
- <b>Question Model</b>

```json
{
  "question": {
    "title": "String (required)",
    "songUrl": "String",
    "options": [
      {
        "optionid": "Number (required)",
        "value": "String (required)"
      }
    ],
    "correctOptionId": "Number (required)",
    "category": "String (required)",
    "totalAttempts": "Number (default: 0)",
    "difficulty": "Number (default: 0.5)",
    "altText": "String (default: '')",
    "createdAt": "Date (default: Current timestamp)"
  }
}
```
- <b>User Model</b>
```json
{
  "user": {
    "username": "String (required, unique, trim)",
    "email": "String (required, unique, trim)",
    "imageUrl": "String",
    "password": "String (required, 'Password is required')",
    "gamesPlayed": "Number (default: 0)",
    "forgotPasswordToken": "String",
    "forgotPasswordTokenExpiry": "Date",
    "refreshToken": "String",
    "createdAt": "Date (default: Current timestamp)"
  }
}
```

### Scoring
The score for each question is determined using the formula below.

<div align="center">  

```math
score = max(0, -0.00057 \times timeTaken^3 + 0.037 \times timeTaken^2 - 0.96 \times timeTaken + 10)
```
